# The Not-for-AirPods Liberation Kit

Repairs on the 1st and 2nd generation of *a certain model of wireless buds* cases are notoriously almost impossible. The white plastic shell will get damaged. What if instead of spending hours damaging that shell, we spend just 5 minutes carefully cutting it into two pieces. Then anything inside can be repaired (battery, Lightning connector, ...).

But then the white plastic shell will be useless?! Yes. And you can't buy a replacement part anywhere?! Yes.

This is what this folder is for. To give you that replacement part.

Yes, yes I would. If only I could...

## I'm lost?:

File *liberation-gen1.stl* will fit the Gen. 1.

File *liberation-gen2.stl* will fit the Gen. 2 wireless. Non-wireless should also fit but I haven't tried it yet. Will update if I do.

## How to install it?:

I highly suggest you watch my video (link).
Cutting the case open is shown at !!!!!! .
Printing is shown at !!!!!! .
For best results I recommend you print with an SLA printer.
But, if you only have an FDM printer ("only"..., that's already awesome!) I would try printing anyway. If you don't like the quality and feel of it, I would suggest looking into printing it with ABS and then doing an acetone vapour bath ;)

## Improvements for the future:

- Waterproofing
- Adding some screw holes to easily open it up again
- Sky is the limit, really.
